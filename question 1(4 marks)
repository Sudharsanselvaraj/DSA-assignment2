Mr. Ram is developing a software application to manage his inventory, which initially can hold a maximum of ten product packets. He allocates memory for ten packets at the start. However, as the market demand changes, he needs to dynamically update the allocated memory to store more or fewer packets without wasting memory or running out of space. Explain the concept of dynamic memory allocation and how Mr. Ram can effectively manage his inventory size using this concept.

ANSWER :
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *inventory = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    if (inventory == NULL) 
    {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    free(inventory);
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT :
=== Code Execution Successful ===
