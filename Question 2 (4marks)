Mr. John is playing the game Subway Surfers. The game has a total of five treasures with different weights, that he needs to collect. Write a C program to count the total number of weights he collected from the treasures during the game.

CODE :

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int weights[5];
    int totalWeight = 0;  
    printf("Enter the weights of the 5 treasures:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Weight of treasure %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &weights[i]);
        totalWeight += weights[i]; 
    }
    printf("The total weight of the collected treasures is: %d\n", totalWeight);

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT :

Enter the weights of the 5 treasures:
Weight of treasure 1: 20
Weight of treasure 2: 40
Weight of treasure 3: 35
Weight of treasure 4: 35
Weight of treasure 5: 10
The total weight of the collected treasures is: 140
