Students need to check the availability of a book in the library based on its ID. Create an ordered list which will contain only book id. Implement a C program to search whether a particular book is available in the list or not

CODE :

#include <stdio.h>
int binarySearch(int books[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = size - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (books[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Book ID found, return the index
        }
        if (books[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int books[] = {101, 203, 345, 456, 567, 678, 789, 890}; 
    int size = sizeof(books)

    int target;
    printf("Enter the book ID to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &target);

    int result = binarySearch(books, size, target);

    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Book ID %d is available in the library.\n", target);
    } else {
        printf("Book ID %d is not available in the library.\n", target);
    }

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT :

Enter the book ID to search: 456
Book ID 456 is available in the library.

Enter the book ID to search: 555
Book ID 555 is not available in the library.
